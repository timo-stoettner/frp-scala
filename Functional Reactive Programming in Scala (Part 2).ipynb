    "1. We exchanged our integer types with generic types in all applicable places.\n",
    "2. We renamed `initVal` to `expr` to illustrate that we are not just passing integer values around anymore but that we are working with arbitrary expressions. Also, we defined `expr` as call-by-name (`expr: => T`), meaning that it won't be evaluated immediately.\n",
    "3. We added another variable `curExpr` that stores our expression without evaluating it and that can be updated to a new expression when needed. The syntax `var curExpr: () => T = () => expr` might need a few glances to wrap your head around. It defines a `var` of type `() => T` (an anonymous function) with the value `() => expr`. We can then call `curExpr()` to evaluate the expression.\n",
    "4. Our `update` method now updates both `curExpr` and `curVal`\n",
    "\n",
    "This gets us a step closer to our first working implementation. But as you might have guessed, it doesn't work yet. `expr` gets evaluated once we reach `private var curVal = expr`. So nothing really changes. (If you run the code from the end of the last article with these implementations of `Signal` and `Var`, you'll get the same results. I encourage you to try it out for yourself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As I wrote above, `total` needs to be recomputed everytime one of our `BankAccount`s balances changes. To ensure this, we need to keep track of the `Signal`s that depend on (i.e. \"observe\") our individual balances. If we don't know which `Signal`s depend on our balances, we don't know what we need to recompute once they change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the observer pattern we solve this problem by having the consolidator explicitly subscribe to every subject (i.e. `BankAccount`) it depends on. However, we want to write code that is more elegant than the observer pattern. The observer pattern requires quite a bit of boilerplate code that we want to avoid here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we solve this for our implementation of `Signal` and `Var`? Let's have a look.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Keeping Track of Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach to keeping track of which `Signal`s need to be recomputed once a specific `Signal` changes, is to specifically pass the \"subjects\" it depends on to its constructor. When we initialize the `Signal`, we then need to tell it two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The expression it is supposed to compute\n",
    "2. The other `Signal`s it is supposed to watch for changes, so it can recompute its value when they change\n",
