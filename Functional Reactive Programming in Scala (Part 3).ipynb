Without going into more depth than necessary, a scope of a computer program refers to the region of that program where you can use an identifier (such as a variable name). There are two ways of scoping: *Lexical (or static) scoping* and *dynamic scoping*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard is lexical scoping, which is what you most likely are used to. Here the scope depends on the location in the source code. For example, if you use a variable name in a class method, the compiler first looks for that name in the method itself and then on the class level.\n",

Here, when you use a variable name in a class method, the compiler will first look for that name in the method itself and then *in the method that called that method* (and so on). There are a few programming languages implementing dynamic scoping, but the vast majority (such as scala) uses static scoping by default.\n",
