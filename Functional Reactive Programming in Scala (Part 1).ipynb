    "# Functional Reactive Programming in Scala from Scratch (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the [reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org) has been published, reactive programming has been experiencing quite a bit of a hype. A bunch of libraries have been developed for basically every major programming language which facilitate reactive programming. Among the most prominent of them are the ReactiveX Libraries that exist for Javascript, Python, Scala and a quite few others.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these libraries are great, they are not to be confused with *functional* reactive programming. As is stated in the documentation of ReactiveX itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is sometimes called “functional reactive programming” but this is a misnomer. ReactiveX may be functional, and it may be reactive, but “functional reactive programming” is a different animal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The main point of difference between reactive libraries such as ReactiveX and Functional Reactive Programming is that these libraries mostly just look at *events* and not at *behaviours*. Events are discrete values that are emitted over time, such as mouse clicks. Behaviours are continuous values that always have a current value, such as the mouse position.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mouse click itself does not have a value - it's just an event that gets fired everytime the user clicks somewhere. A mouse position, on the other hand, always has a current value - but it doesn't get \"fired\" at certain points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're confused about all of this, have a look at my article [Demystifying Functional Reactive Programming](https://itnext.io/demystifying-functional-reactive-programming-67767dbe520b) discussing all of these buzz words I just dropped in much more detail."

    "In this series of articles we are going to develop a little framework for Functional Reactive Programming in Scala, step-by-step and entirely from scratch. The code we'll look at is a simplified version of Martin Odersky's and Ingo Maier's Scala.React that is also described in the paper [Deprecating  the  Observer  Pattern with  Scala.React](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/176887/files/DeprecatingObservers2012.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "I got inspired to write this by watching a [video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/progfun2/lecture-4-2-functional-reactive-programming-pEsTy) of Martin Odersky's online course on Functional Programming, where he shortly explains parts of Scala.React. However, if you're not Martin Odersky, you might find the video pretty hard to follow. There's quite a lot going on in the code that doesn't immediately meet the eye. This series of posts will be an attempt to explain the concepts more gently. I believe the proposed programming framework results in very elegant code and even if you don't use it in your daily work, there's a lot to learn from it.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive Programming is often explained with an analogy to a spreadsheet. Imagine a cell containing the sum of two other cells. If you change the value of one cell, the cell containing the sum will be immediately updated as well - it *reacts* to the other cell's update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terms of classical Functional Reactive Programming, the cells' values are *behaviours*. They contain values that change over time. The sum is a *function* of time that depends on the other two cells' values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviours are sometimes also referred to as *signals*. In the following I will also call it *signal* because I find it to be a better word for it. (A signal doesn't just 'behave' the way it wants, but it reflects a value that might in turn depend on other signals.) Also, Scala.React calls it signal as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will look at a very similar but slightly simpler example, not to complicate things unnecessarily. We will look at an example of a BankAccount class the let's you deposit and withdraw money. A consolidator will then sum up the BankAccounts you tell it to depend on, so you know your total balance at all times. (The consolidator is the analog to the sum-cell in the spreadsheet example.)"

    "Pretty elegant, isn't it? In the end you'll be able to simply call `total()` to get the current value of your two bank accounts whenever you feel like it. You won't have to keep track of observers and subjects as in the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern).
