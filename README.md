# Functional Reactive Programming in Scala from Scratch

Notebooks accompanying my blog posts on how to write a FRP framework on medium: https://medium.com/@timo.stoettner/functional-reactive-programming-in-scala-from-scratch-part-1-9f9db0c47478

The code is inspired by Martin Odersky's and Ingo Meier's scala.react: https://github.com/ingoem/scala-react

Note that you need to install Jupyter with a scala kernel to run the notebooks.
